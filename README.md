# key_logger

**!!!! This is for educational purpose only. !!!!**

The provided code is a simple keylogger written in Python using the `pynput` library. A keylogger is a program designed to capture and log keystrokes made by a user without their knowledge.

Summary of the code:
1. Import required libraries: The code begins by importing necessary modules such as `pynput` for keyboard monitoring, `Semaphore` and `Timer` from `threading` for handling concurrency, and `Key` and `Listener` from `pynput.keyboard` for key event handling.

2. Define the `keylogger` class: The code defines a class named `keylogger`, which will encapsulate the keylogging functionality.

3. `__init__` method: The constructor initializes the keylogger with a specified `interval`, which determines the time interval (in seconds) for which the keystrokes are logged. It also sets up an empty `self.log` variable to store the captured keystrokes.

4. `start` method: The `start` method initiates the keylogger by starting a `Listener` from `pynput.keyboard` with the `on_press` callback set to `self.on_press`. This listener waits for key presses and triggers the `on_press` method whenever a key is pressed. The `Listener` runs on a separate thread and stays active until the program is terminated.

5. `backspace` method: This method takes a string `b` as input and processes it to simulate backspace functionality. It removes the characters marked with '#' from the string, effectively simulating a backspace operation.

6. `on_press` method: This method is the callback function executed whenever a key is pressed. It first converts the key to a string and checks if the key is a special key (e.g., ctrl, alt, etc.) or a regular character. If it's a special key, it is handled accordingly, while regular characters are logged into the `logs.txt` file. The method also handles the backspace key, removing the last character from the log file.

7. `write` method: This method is used to write the captured keystrokes (characters) to the `logs.txt` file.

8. `__main__` block: In this block, an instance of the `keylogger` class is created with an interval of 600 seconds (10 minutes). The keylogger is then started by calling the `start` method, which sets up the key press listener and starts capturing keystrokes.

Important Note: It's essential to understand that using keyloggers without the user's knowledge or consent is unethical and, in many cases, illegal. Keyloggers are often associated with malicious intent, such as stealing sensitive information like passwords. Always ensure you have the legal right and explicit consent to use such tools. This code should be used for educational purposes only and should not be used for any unethical or harmful activities.
